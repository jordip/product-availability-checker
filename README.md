## Description

Keep your Amazon affiliate website healthy and maximize revenue. Don’t leave behind old Amazon links pointing to out of stock or unavailable products.

This simple plugin will scan your website for affiliate links pointing to Amazon, extract the ASIN and check it against the Amazon API to determine if it is still in stock, and can be purchased.

## Install

1. Upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to Amazon Products > Settings and configure your Amazon Product Avertising API v5 credentials
4. Navigate to Amazon Products > Scan to scan every post and page for Amazon products that are no longer available to buy
